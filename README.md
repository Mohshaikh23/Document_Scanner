# COLOR TRACKING

This project is a color tracking application that uses computer vision techniques to track specific colors in real-time using a webcam.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
Python 3
OpenCV
NumPy
```

Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-tracking.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd color-tracking
```

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python color_tracking.py
```

The webcam feed will open, and the application will start tracking the specified colors.

Press the 'q' key to quit the application.

Configuration
You can customize the color tracking settings by modifying the following variables in the color_tracking.py file:

frame_width: Desired width of the webcam frame.
frame_height: Desired height of the webcam frame.
cap.set(10, 150): Adjust the brightness of the webcam feed. Values range from 0 to 255.
To add or modify the tracked colors, update the my_color and color_value lists in the color_tracking.py file. Each color is defined by two lists: the lower and upper HSV values.
